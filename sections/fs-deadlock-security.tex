{\bf Recap of address
translation}
page replacement algorithms need to avoid thrashing (it prevents useful work). Some solutions
to thrashing include: swapping (write out all pages of procerss and suspsend it) and the OOM killer daemon.

Previously, we assumed that the replacement algorithm chooses a victim page
when a \emph{new page needs to be brought in}. But these algorithms are too
costly to run on every page fault. Instead, we maintain a pool of free pages,
run replacement algorithm when pool is small, grab a page on frame from free
list on page fault, and Frames on free list can be rescued if virtual page is
referenced before reallocation.
{\bf Where to store page
tables } can store them in physical memory (no translation required) or in virtual memory.
{\bf Managing swap space} here we can use a raw disk partition, or use a large
file in FS. tradeoffs include choosing when the swap be allocated/freed.
{\bf Address translation
reduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Read Access (Load)
\item
  Address goes to Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) in Memory
  Management Unit (MMU)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    TLB does lookup using page number of address
  \item
    Returns Page Table Entry (PTE) for the mapping of this address.
    \emph{Could Miss}
  \item
    TLB validates the PTE protection (allows read) \emph{Could Miss}
  \item
    PTE specifies which \emph{physical} frame holds the page
  \item
    MMU combines physical frame and offset into a \emph{physical
    address}.
  \item
    PTE specifies which \emph{physical} frame holds the page
  \item
    MMU combines physical frame and offset into a \emph{physical
    address}.
  \item
    MMU reads from that physical address and returns value to CPI.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This is all done by hardware.
\item
  If the TLB does not have a mapping, either:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    MMU loads PTE from page table in memory. (OS not involved in this)
  \item
    OS has already set up the page tables so the hardware can access it
    directly.
  \item
    Trap to OS (Software managed TLB)
  \item
    OS does a lookup in page table and loads PTE into TLB.
  \item
    Return from the exception, and retry memory address.
  \item
    This is known as a \emph{minor page fault}. We have now created a
    PTE for the addr in the TLB
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Implementatoin concerns} How do we determine how much memory to give each
process? We can use: (1) fixed space algorithms: when we reach space limit, do
local replacement. or (2) variable space algorithms, where space of a page
grows/shrinks dynamically (but one process can ruin it for the rest lol). or
(3) a working set model, where $WS(t,d) = \{ p \in {\tt Pages} \bar p {\text
referenced in } (t-d, t)$, where $t$ is time and $d$ is the working set window,
meausred in page references. The working set (WS) changes with program
locality, poor locality implies more page references, and it needs to be the
set of pages a process needs in mem to prevent faulting, so we dont run a
process unless the working set of that process is in memory. this is not
practical cuz dertermining $d$ is difficult.  {\bf Shared Memory} is used to
allow processes to share data using \emph{direct memory references}.  Here,
both page tables map to the same physical frame, and each PTE can have
different protecion values, and we need to update both PTEs when a page table
becomes valid.
{\bf Copy on Write}
Defers large copies as long as possible, in hopes to avoid them
altogether.uses   \emph{Shared mappings} instead. these are protected as read only.
{\bf File Systems}
File systems provide long term info storage. they need to (1) store large amounts of info that (2) needs to persist and (3) must be accessible.
The OS needs to manage the physical storage media, and enforce access
restriction, while the user only needs a convenient way of organizing
information.
We abstract secondary storage using \emph{files}, and we organize files
using \emph{directories}.
{\bf Files}
{\bf Operations } done on files: (1) Creation, (2) writin, (3) reading, (4) repositioning, (5) deleting (the whole file) (6) truncating (deleting contents of file)
The attributes of a file are stored in a suystem wide \emph{open-file
table}. The page is located at the index of its file descriptior (hence
\texttt{FILE\ *fd}). In this way we can do operations on a file.
{\bf Directories}
Directories provide a convenient naming interface for the file system,
which allows for the implementation to distinguish between local file
organization and physical memory placement on disk.
A directory is a usually unordered list of entries, which are names and
associated \emph{metadata}. Entries are usually sorted by the program
that reads the directory.
Directories are usually stored in files. In this way, you only need to
manage on kind secondary storage unit.
We can organize directories as a tree or a general acyclic graph.
Acyclic graphs allow for shared directories. We can implement this using
a linear list or a Hash table.
{\bf Sharing}
Sharing files is the basis for communications and synchronization.
Key issues: semantics of concurrent access, protection.
2 levels of internal tables: (1) Per-process table that stores the files that
process has open. (2) The entry of the per-process table points to an entry in
the system-wide open-file file table. (this gives process independent info).
General-purpose file systems support simple methods, like sequential
access (one byte at a time) and direct access (random access given a
number of bytes).
Database systems support more sophisticated methods, like indexed
accesses or record accesses.
{\bf File Links}
We can implement sharing by creating a \emph{link}. A link is a
directory entry that points to another file or subdirectory. We do this
with \emph{hard links} (second directy entry identical to first) or a
symbolic link (holds the true path to the linked file).
The issue with acyclic graphs is traversal, and updating permissions,
etc. is more difficult.
{\bf File System Implementation}
Define a \emph{block size} (like 4kb). The disk space is allocated in
granulatiry of blocks
Define a \emph{master block}, which determines the location of the root
directory. This is usually placed at a well known disk location, and
replicated across disk for reliability.
Define a \emph{free map} which determines which blocks are free. This is
usually a bitmap, with one bit per block on the disk. This is also
stored on disk and cached in memory for performance.
{\bf Disk Layout Strategies}
We develop a solutions to finding all the blocks for a file that spans multiple
blocks.  \emph{Contiguous Allocation} is like meomory, fast and simple, but
inflexible and causes fragemntation \emph{Linked/Changed structure}, where each
blocks points to the next, and the directory points to the first.
\emph{Indexed structure}, where each ``index block'' contains pointers to other
blocks. This handles randomness better, but may need multiple index blocks
linked together.
{\bf Inodes}
Inodes implement an indexed file structure for file.
All metadata is stored in inodes.
Inodes contain 15 block pointers.
Inodes are smaller than disk blocks.
The system spends a lot of time walking directory paths, and this is why
\emph{open} is separate from \emph{read/write}.
It's important to note that \texttt{inodes} are \emph{not} directories,
but they describe where on the disk the blocks for a file are placed.
\emph{Directory entries map file names \texttt{inodes}}
