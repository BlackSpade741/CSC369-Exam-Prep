# CSC369 - Fall 2016

## Getting output

First, make `latexrun` an executable:

   ```
   $ chmod u+x latexrun
   ```

To get the pdf output, open the pdf file generated by `latexrun`

If you are using vim, using `:make` will run the makefile. You can set up
something in your text editor that does something similar (or just use a LaTeX
ide, and then you wont need the Makefile).  

## Contributing

If you want to add a lecutre, create a LaTeX file in `lectures/` called
`lecture[n].tex`, and then type regular LaTeX; use `lectures/lecuture1.tex` for
reference.  When you are done, go to `cheatsheet.tex` and under
`\input{lectures/lecture1}` your file as `\input{lecture/lecture[n]}`.

Do NOT commit the pdf file, and do NOT commit any logs or output files.

## Sections

The Cheatsheet should be split into 5 section:
  1. Definitions
  2. Processes, Threads, System Calls
  3. Synchronization, Condition Variables, Scheduling
  4. Scheduling, Memory Management, Paging
  5. File Systems, Deadlock, Security
