# CSC369 - Fall 2016

## Getting output

First, make `latexrun` an executable:

   ```
   $ chmod u+x latexrun
   ```

To get the pdf output, open the pdf file generated by `latexrun`

If you are using vim, using `:make` will run the makefile. You can set up
something in your text editor that does something similar (or just use a LaTeX
ide, and then you wont need the Makefile).  

## Contributing
